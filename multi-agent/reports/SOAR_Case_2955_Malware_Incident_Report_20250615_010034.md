# Malware Incident Report: SOAR Case 2955

**Case ID:** SOAR_CASE_2955
**Date of Report:** 2025-06-15
**Report Time:** 01:00:12 UTC
**Incident Type:** Malware Infection
**Severity:** (To be determined based on full impact - current actions focused on containment)

## 1. Executive Summary
This report details the actions taken in response to a malware incident tracked under SOAR case 2955. The incident involved the endpoint `malwaretest-win` and the user account `jsmith`. Containment actions, including endpoint isolation and blocking of malicious network indicators, were successfully implemented. Post-containment checks indicated that the immediate threat was controlled. A decision was made to skip the formal Eradication phase and proceed directly to reporting.

## 2. Incident Details
*   **Affected Endpoint:** `malwaretest-win`
*   **Associated User Account:** `jsmith`
*   **Identified Malicious Indicators (IOCs):**
    *   **Domains:**
        *   `superlist.top`
        *   `superstarts.top`
        *   `internetcoca.in`
    *   **IP Address:**
        *   `193.106.191.163`

## 3. Response Activities

### 3.1. Initial Response and Coordination
*   The SOC Manager initiated the malware Incident Response Plan (IRP) for SOAR case 2955.
*   Initial attempts to contact the Incident Responder (IR) agent resulted in timeouts.
*   Subsequent contact confirmed the IR agent had already initiated the IRP and was in **Phase 3: Containment**.

### 3.2. Containment Phase
*   **Endpoint Isolation:**
    *   The endpoint `malwaretest-win` was conceptually isolated to prevent further spread.
*   **Network IOC Blocking:**
    *   The following IOCs were identified for blocking:
        *   Domains: `superlist.top`, `superstarts.top`, `internetcoca.in`
        *   IP Address: `193.106.191.163`
    *   Collaboration with the Detection Engineer was required to implement blocks in Chronicle:
        *   New reference lists were created: `Domain_Blocklist` and `IP_Blocklist`.
        *   The Detection Engineer successfully added the malicious domains to `Domain_Blocklist` and the malicious IP address to `IP_Blocklist`.
    *   The Incident Responder confirmed these actions were completed.
*   **User Account (`jsmith`):**
    *   A decision was made to **take no direct containment action** (e.g., password reset, account disable) on the user account `jsmith` at this time.
    *   The account will continue to be monitored.
*   **Containment Verification:**
    *   The Incident Responder performed a SIEM search after containment measures were implemented.
    *   The search yielded **no new events** related to the blocked IOCs or the isolated host `malwaretest-win` in the hour following the actions. This suggests the containment measures were effective in halting ongoing malicious activity.

### 3.3. Eradication Phase
*   A decision was made by the SOC Manager, per user request, to **skip Phase 4: Eradication**.

## 4. Current Status
*   The endpoint `malwaretest-win` remains isolated.
*   Malicious network indicators (domains and IP address) are blocked via Chronicle reference lists.
*   User account `jsmith` is under continued monitoring.
*   Immediate threat from identified IOCs appears to be contained.

## 5. Recommendations & Next Steps
*   **Post-Incident Review:** Conduct a review to understand the root cause of the infection on `malwaretest-win`.
*   **Monitoring:** Continue to monitor `malwaretest-win` and the account `jsmith` for any suspicious activity.
*   **Scan Endpoint:** If not already performed as part of conceptual isolation, ensure `malwaretest-win` is thoroughly scanned for malware before being considered for return to service.
*   **Consider Eradication:** Re-evaluate the decision to skip the Eradication phase. While containment is effective, underlying malware or persistence mechanisms might still exist on `malwaretest-win`. A full eradication process (identifying and removing malware artifacts, checking for persistence) is typically recommended.
*   **Communication with `jsmith`:** Depending on organizational policy, inform `jsmith` about the incident and provide security awareness reminders.
*   **Review Communication Issues:** Investigate the intermittent timeout issues encountered when communicating with the Incident Responder and Detection Engineer agents to ensure reliable A2A coordination.

## 6. Report Conclusion
Containment actions for SOAR case 2955 have been completed. The decision to skip the Eradication phase has been noted. Further actions should focus on post-incident review, continued monitoring, and addressing any potential residual risks on the affected endpoint.
