# Malware Incident Response - Interim Report: Case 2483

**Case ID:** 2483
**Case Name:** ursnif_malware_dns
**Report Date:** 20250519_123708

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the findings of the Malware Incident Response Plan (IRP) for Case ID 2483 up to the current point. Initial triage and malware analysis have identified activity consistent with Ursnif/Gozi malware on the endpoint `malwaretest-win`, involving user `jsmith`. Key malicious indicators of compromise (IOCs) include IP address `193.106.191.163` and domains `superlist.top` and `superstarts.top`. The malware, identified as `rundll32.exe` (SHA256: `7d99c80a1249a1ec9af0f3047c855778b06ea57e11943a271071985afe09e6c2`) acting as a LOLBAS, was executed with a malicious command. Previous attempts at containment faced tool errors for network IOC blocking, and endpoint isolation was skipped. This report summarizes the investigation findings before further actions are taken.

## 2. Malware IRP - Phase 2: Identification

**Responsible Persona (Overall):** SOC Manager (Orchestrating IRP)
**Lead for this Phase (Executed by SOC Analyst T1):** SOC Analyst T1

### 2.1. Initial Triage (`.clinerules/run_books/triage_alerts.md`)

*   **Case Details:**
    *   ID: 2483
    *   Name: ursnif_malware_dns
    *   Priority: Critical
    *   Status: Opened
    *   Assignee: @Tier1
*   **Key Entities Identified from Case Data & Comments:**
    *   File Hash: `7d99c80a1249a1ec9af0f3047c855778b06ea57e11943a271071985afe09e6c2` (Original Name: `rundll32.exe`)
    *   Affected Host: `malwaretest-win`
    *   Affected User: `jsmith`
    *   IP Address: `193.106.191.163`
    *   Domains: `superlist.top`, `superstarts.top`
*   **Duplicate Check:** Attempted using `siemplify_get_similar_cases` but failed due to a tool error (missing `alert_group_identifiers`). No duplicates were assumed for triage continuation.
*   **Related Case Search:** `list_cases` was used. No other cases appeared directly related to the specific IOCs of Case 2483.
*   **Alert-Specific SIEM Search (`secops-mcp.search_security_events`):**
    *   Query: `events involving superlist.top OR superstarts.top OR 193.106.191.163` (last 24 hours)
    *   Findings: 54 events, primarily `NETWORK_DNS` (SuspiciousDnsRequestV2 - Crowdstrike Falcon) for the domains and `NETWORK_CONNECTION` (NetworkCloseIP4 - Crowdstrike Falcon) to the IP on port 80. All originated from `malwaretest-win`, process `\Device\CdRom1\me\123.com` (SHA256 matching above, original name `RUNDLL32.EXE`), command `me\\123.com me/itsIt.db,DllRegisterServer`, parent process `wscript.exe`.
*   **Basic Enrichment (`gti-mcp`, `secops-mcp.lookup_entity`):**
    *   **IP 193.106.191.163:** GTI Reputation -2, Threat Severity NONE (but with bad communicating files and collection association), ASN 201150 (Didehban Net Company PJS, Iran). Associated with Ursnif/Gozi collections.
    *   **Domain superlist.top:** GTI Reputation -1, Threat Severity NONE (similar caveats), Mandiant IC Score 87. Associated with Ursnif/Gozi.
    *   **Domain superstarts.top:** GTI Reputation -57, Threat Severity NONE (similar caveats), Mandiant IC Score 92. Expired. Associated with Ursnif/Gozi.
    *   **File Hash 7d99c80a1249a1ec9af0f3047c855778b06ea57e11943a271071985afe09e6c2:** GTI Reputation 1 (largely undetected by AV). Identified as `RUNDLL32.EXE` (LOLBAS). GTI Crowdsourced AI links its use to Ursnif/Cobalt Strike delivery campaigns. Sandbox analysis showed benign network activity, not matching the malicious C2 observed in SIEM.
    *   **Host malwaretest-win:** Active. `lookup_entity` showed no specific alerts/events in its summary.
    *   **User jsmith:** `lookup_entity` found no direct info, but SIEM events confirm user activity.
*   **Initial Assessment:** True Positive / Highly Suspicious.
*   **SOAR Comment:** Posted by SOC Analyst T1 summarizing these findings (ID 54).

### 2.2. Malware Triage (`.clinerules/run_books/malware_triage.md`)

*   **File Hash:** `7d99c80a1249a1ec9af0f3047c855778b06ea57e11943a271071985afe09e6c2`
*   **GTI File Report:** Details largely covered in 2.1. Key is its identity as `rundll32.exe` and its known use in malware campaigns.
*   **GTI Behavior Summary (`gti-mcp.get_file_behavior_summary`):** Sandbox analysis showed mostly benign behavior for `rundll32.exe` itself (DNS to Microsoft, Mozilla). No direct observation of the malicious C2 in this generic summary, as expected since the malicious COM object was loaded by it.
*   **SIEM Execution Check:** Confirmed from previous steps: Executed on `malwaretest-win` by `jsmith` via `wscript.exe`, command `me\\123.com me/itsIt.db,DllRegisterServer`.
*   **SIEM Network Activity Check:** Confirmed from previous steps: C2 to `193.106.191.163`, DNS for `superlist.top`, `superstarts.top`.
*   **Enrich Network IOCs:** Confirmed malicious and linked to Ursnif/Gozi.
*   **Check Related SOAR Cases:** No new related cases found.
*   **Synthesize & Document:** Malware identified as Ursnif/Gozi, using `rundll32.exe` as LOLBAS. Critical severity. Recommendations included proceeding to Containment, isolating `malwaretest-win`, blocking network IOCs, and evaluating user `jsmith` for account compromise response.
*   **SOAR Comment:** Posted by SOC Analyst T1 summarizing Malware Triage (ID 55).

## 3. Malware IRP - Phase 3: Containment (Previous Attempt - Summary from Case Comments)

*   **Endpoint Isolation:** Previously skipped by an analyst for `malwaretest-win` (per case comment 53).
*   **Network IOC Containment:** FAILED. Attempts to add IP `193.106.191.163` and domains `superlist.top`, `superstarts.top` to Chronicle reference lists via `google_chronicle_add_values_to_reference_list` failed with "Object reference not set to an instance of an object." Manual blocking was recommended (per case comment 53).
*   **User Account Containment:** User `jsmith` was identified. Guidance on whether to proceed with the "Compromised User Account Response" runbook was pending (per case comment 53).

## 4. Current Status & Next Steps

The Identification phase (Phase 2) of the Malware IRP is complete. Initial attempts at Containment (Phase 3) were problematic.

The SOC Analyst T1 was about to re-address endpoint isolation for `malwaretest-win` when the request to generate this report was made.

**Recommendations before proceeding:**
1.  **Resolve Tooling Issues:** Investigate and fix the "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" error affecting `google_chronicle_add_values_to_reference_list` to enable network IOC containment via SOAR.
2.  **Re-evaluate Endpoint Isolation:** SOC Manager to decide if `malwaretest-win` should be isolated now, given the confirmed malware activity.
3.  **User Account Containment Decision:** SOC Manager to decide on actions for user `jsmith` (e.g., trigger Compromised User Account IRP).
4.  Once tooling and immediate containment decisions are addressed, proceed with the remaining steps of Phase 3 (Containment), followed by Phase 4 (Eradication), Phase 5 (Recovery), and Phase 6 (Lessons Learned) of the Malware IRP.
