# A2A SOAR Integration Status Report

**Date:** January 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - MCP Tools Successfully Integrated

## Current Objective

Create a dedicated SOAR Specialist agent for the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) system that can handle SOAR platform operations, specifically the ability to list recent SOAR cases and perform other SOAR-related tasks.

## What's Currently Working

### ✅ A2A System Infrastructure
- **CTI Researcher A2A Agent**: Fully functional on port 8001
- **SOC Analyst Tier 1 A2A Agent**: Fully functional on port 8002  
- **Host Agent**: Successfully coordinates with the two working agents
- **Startup Scripts**: `start_a2a_system.sh` properly launches multiple agents
- **Form-based Interactions**: Both CTI and SOC agents handle form workflows correctly

### ✅ SOAR Agent Structure
- **SOAR Specialist A2A Agent**: Basic structure created at `/Users/dandye/Projects/adk_runbooks/multi-agent/manager/sub_agents/soar_specialist/`
- **Server Configuration**: `run_server.py` and `agent_a2a.py` files exist
- **Form-based Tools**: Case management forms (create_case_management_form, return_case_form, create_case) are implemented
- **Dependencies**: All required packages (google-adk, fastapi, uvicorn, etc.) are installed

## ✅ Problem Solved

The SOAR Specialist agent now **successfully accesses MCP tools** to perform SOAR platform operations. When tested with "List recent SOAR cases from the last 24 hours", the agent:

- Successfully initializes 80 MCP tools from the SOAR toolset
- Uses the `secops_soar.list_cases` tool to retrieve cases
- Returns a properly formatted list of recent SOAR cases with details including case IDs, priorities, statuses, and timestamps

## Technical Solution Implemented

### 1. MCP Tool Loading Solution
**Solution**: Implemented proper async initialization pattern with CustomMCPToolset

**Key Changes**:
- ✅ Added async `_initialize_mcp_tools()` method to handle MCP toolset creation
- ✅ Used `CustomMCPToolset` from `utils.custom_adk_patches` for proper timeout handling
- ✅ Implemented lazy initialization in `_ensure_initialized()` called before stream processing
- ✅ Added proper cleanup handling in `cleanup()` method and server shutdown

**Result**: Successfully loads 80 MCP tools from the SOAR toolset

### 2. Virtual Environment Resolution
**Solution**: Used `uv` command with proper directory and environment configuration

**Implementation**:
```python
StdioServerParameters(
    command='uv',
    args=[
        "--directory",
        "/Users/dandye/Projects/mcp_security_debugging/server/secops-soar/secops_soar_mcp",
        "run",
        "--env-file",
        "/Users/dandye/Projects/google-mcp-security/.env",
        "server.py",
        "--integrations",
        "CSV,GoogleChronicle,Siemplify,SiemplifyUtilities"
    ]
)
```

### 3. Port Management
**Solution**: Added proper cleanup handling to prevent port conflicts
- Implemented shutdown event handler in FastAPI
- Added signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Process cleanup in startup script

## Architecture Analysis

### Current A2A Pattern
The working agents (CTI Researcher, SOC Analyst Tier 1) follow this pattern:
1. **Standalone FastAPI servers** with form-based interactions
2. **No direct MCP tool access** - they focus on form workflows
3. **Host agent coordination** through REST API calls
4. **Session management** through A2A SDK

### Traditional Manager Pattern  
The traditional multi-agent system uses:
1. **MCPToolset with StdioServerParameters** to launch external MCP servers
2. **Complex async initialization** with connection management
3. **Full MCP tool access** through properly configured toolsets

## Solution Implemented: Full MCP Integration

Successfully implemented **Option 2: Full MCP Integration** with the following approach:

### Implementation Details

1. **Async Initialization Pattern**:
   - Created `_initialize_mcp_tools()` method for async MCP toolset creation
   - Implemented `_ensure_initialized()` for lazy initialization on first request
   - MCP tools are loaded once and reused across requests

2. **Custom MCP Toolset Integration**:
   - Used `CustomMCPToolset` from `utils.custom_adk_patches`
   - Provides configurable timeout (60s instead of default 5s)
   - Handles stdio-based MCP server connections properly

3. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Proper cleanup in `cleanup()` method
   - FastAPI shutdown event handler
   - Exit stack for managing MCP server connections

4. **Tool Access**:
   - Full access to 80 SOAR MCP tools
   - Seamless integration with form-based tools
   - Agent can handle both direct SOAR queries and guided workflows

### Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Full SOAR Functionality**: A2A agent can now list cases, get details, update status, etc.
- ✅ **Consistent Experience**: Users don't need to switch between systems
- ✅ **Proper Resource Management**: Clean startup and shutdown
- ✅ **Reliable Performance**: Custom timeout prevents premature disconnections

## Current State of Files

### Working Files
- `multi-agent/manager/host_agent.py` - Host agent with all 3 agent connections
- `multi-agent/start_a2a_system.sh` - Startup script for 3 agents  
- `multi-agent/manager/sub_agents/cti_researcher/agent_a2a.py` - Working CTI agent
- `multi-agent/manager/sub_agents/soc_analyst_tier1/agent_a2a.py` - Working SOC agent

### Updated Files
- `multi-agent/manager/sub_agents/soar_specialist/agent_a2a.py` - ✅ SOAR agent with full MCP tool integration
- `multi-agent/manager/sub_agents/soar_specialist/run_server.py` - ✅ Server with proper cleanup handling

## Next Steps

### Completed ✅
1. **MCP Tool Integration**: Full SOAR platform access via MCP tools
2. **Async Initialization**: Proper lifecycle management implemented
3. **Port Management**: Cleanup handling prevents conflicts
4. **Testing**: Verified with real SOAR queries

### Recommended Future Enhancements
1. **Performance Optimization**: Consider caching frequently used SOAR data
2. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error messages for MCP connection failures
3. **Documentation**: Create user guide for SOAR operations in A2A mode
4. **Extended Testing**: Test all 80 MCP tools for comprehensive validation
5. **Other A2A Agents**: Apply same MCP integration pattern to other sub-agents needing platform access

## User Experience Impact

### Before Fix
- **A2A System**: Limited to form-based workflows only
- **SOAR Queries**: Required switching to traditional system
- **Confusion**: Mixed expectations about A2A capabilities

### After Fix ✅
- **A2A System**: Full SOAR platform access with 80 MCP tools
- **SOAR Queries**: Work seamlessly in A2A mode
- **Consistency**: Unified experience across all A2A agents
- **Performance**: Reliable with 60-second timeout for complex operations

**Achievement**: Users now have full SOAR functionality in the A2A system without needing to switch contexts.
