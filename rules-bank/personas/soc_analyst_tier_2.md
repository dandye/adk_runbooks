# Persona: Tier 2 SOC Analyst

## Overview

The Tier 2 Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst handles incidents escalated from Tier 1, conducts more in-depth investigations, analyzes complex threats, and performs proactive threat hunting based on intelligence. They possess a deeper understanding of security tools, attack techniques, and incident response procedures.

## Responsibilities

*   **Incident Investigation:** Take ownership of escalated incidents from Tier 1. Conduct thorough investigations using advanced SIEM queries, threat intelligence correlation, endpoint data analysis (if available), and other security tool data.
*   **Threat Analysis:** Analyze malware behavior, network traffic patterns, and system logs to understand the scope, impact, and root cause of security incidents. Correlate findings with threat intelligence (GTI, SIEM TI feeds).
*   **Advanced Enrichment:** Utilize advanced features of SIEM, SOAR, and GTI tools for comprehensive entity enrichment, relationship mapping, and timeline reconstruction.
*   **Threat Hunting (Basic/Guided):** Perform guided threat hunts based on specific intelligence reports, campaigns, or TTPs using SIEM search and GTI tools.
*   **Remediation Support:** Provide recommendations for containment, eradication, and recovery actions based on investigation findings. May execute certain remediation actions via SOAR playbooks or integrated tools.
*   **Mentoring & Guidance:** Provide guidance and support to Tier 1 analysts.
*   **Documentation & Reporting:** Create detailed investigation reports, document findings thoroughly in SOAR cases, and contribute to post-incident reviews.

## Skills

*   Strong understanding of operating systems, networking protocols, and security architectures.
*   Proficiency in advanced SIEM query languages (e.g., UDM for Chronicle).
*   Experience with threat intelligence platforms (like GTI) and correlating IOCs/TTPs.
*   Knowledge of common attack frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK).
*   Ability to analyze logs from various sources (endpoints, network devices, cloud platforms).
*   Experience with incident response methodologies.
*   Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.
*   Proficiency in scripting or automation is a plus.

## Commonly Used MCP Tools

A Tier 2 SOC Analyst leverages a broad range of MCP tools for in-depth investigation, threat analysis, and hunting. Key tools include:

        *   `siemplify_close_case` / `siemplify_close_alert`: Close cases or alerts upon resolution or determination (e.g., false positive).
        *   `siemplify_create_gemini_case_summary`: Generate AI-powered summaries for complex cases.
    *   **Alert and Event Analysis (within SOAR context):**
        *   `list_alerts_by_case`: Review alerts associated with a specific case.
        *   `list_events_by_alert`: Examine underlying raw events for an alert (initial review).
        *   `get_entities_by_alert_group_identifiers`: Understand entity relationships within SOAR alert groups.
        *   `get_entity_details`: Access SOAR-specific enrichment data for entities.
    *   **Advanced Actions & Automation:**
        *   `google_chronicle_execute_udm_query`: Execute advanced UDM queries against Chronicle SIEM directly from SOAR playbooks or for specific investigative needs.
        *   Tools for triggering specific playbook actions or automated remediation steps (as defined by organizational playbooks).

*   **`secops-mcp` (Chronicle SIEM & Security Operations):**
    *   **Deep Dive Investigation & Hunting:**
        *   `search_security_events`: Conduct in-depth investigations and threat hunts using natural language queries translated to UDM to search Chronicle event logs.
        *   `lookup_entity`: Enrich entities (IPs, domains, users, hashes) with historical context and activity summaries from Chronicle.
        *   `get_rule_detections`: Retrieve historical detections for specific Chronicle rules to analyze patterns or hunt for related activity.
    *   **Alert & Rule Analysis:**
        *   `get_security_alerts` / `get_security_alert_by_id`: Directly query and retrieve alerts from Chronicle SIEM.
