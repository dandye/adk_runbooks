    -   [Explain the potential impact if this activity is not detected (e.g., data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, lateral movement).]

## 2. Threat Alignment & Context

-   **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:**
    -   Tactic(s): `[e.g., TA0002 - Execution, TA0005 - Defense Evasion]`
    -   Technique(s): `[e.g., T1059.001 - PowerShell, T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information]`
    -   Sub-Technique(s) (if applicable): `[e.g., T1059.001 - PowerShell: Base64 Encoding]`
-   **Relevant Threat Actors/Campaigns:**
    -   [List known threat actors or campaigns that utilize this TTP. Reference `internal_threat_profile.md` if applicable.]
-   **Severity Assessment (Initial):** [Low, Medium, High, Critical - based on `incident_severity_matrix.md` principles]

## 3. Technical Details & Detection Logic

-   **Data_Sources_Required:**
    -   [List specific log sources needed, e.g., "Windows Security Event Logs (ID 4688)", "EDR Process Events", "Chronicle UDM: `PROCESS_LAUNCH`". Reference `log_source_overview.md`.]
-   **Detection_Logic_Hypothesis / Rule Pseudocode:**
    -   [Describe the core logic for detection. This can be in pseudocode or a clear English description.]
    -   *Example:* "Detect when `powershell.exe` is launched with command-line arguments containing 'Invoke-Expression' AND '-EncodedCommand' AND the parent process is not `explorer.exe` or `cmd.exe`."
-   **Key_IOC_Patterns_or_Behavioral_Signatures:**
    -   [List specific strings, regex patterns, commands, API calls, network patterns, or sequences of events that are indicative of this activity.]
-   **Known_False_Positive_Considerations:**
    -   [What legitimate activity might resemble this? How can it be filtered?]
    -   [Reference `common_benign_alerts.md` or `whitelists.md` if applicable.]
-   **Detection_Platform(s):** [e.g., Chronicle SIEM, EDR Product X, Custom Script]

## 4. Incident Response & Automation Planning

-   **Initial_IR_SOP_Considerations (Draft - to be expanded into a full runbook):**
    1.  **Triage:** [Initial steps to validate the alert - e.g., check AI confidence, verify key indicators.]
    2.  **Investigation:** [Key questions to answer, e.g., What user executed it? What was the parent process? Any network connections made? Any files created/modified? Use `indicator_handling_protocols.md` and `analytical_query_patterns.md`.]
    3.  **Containment (if applicable):** [Potential containment actions, e.g., isolate host, block C2 IP. Reference `automated_response_playbook_criteria.md`.]
    4.  **Eradication (if applicable):** [Potential eradication steps.]
    5.  **Escalation:** [When to escalate to Tier 2/3 or other teams, per `escalation_paths.md`.]
-   **Automation_Feasibility_Assessment:**
    -   **Candidate Steps for Automation:** [Which of the above SOP steps could be automated?]
    -   **Required Tools & Integrations:** [List MCP tools, SOAR integrations needed. Reference `mcp_tool_best_practices.md`.]
    -   **Existing Automation Reuse:** [Can any existing playbooks/scripts from `automated_response_playbook_criteria.md` be leveraged?]
    -   **Data Requirements for Automation:** [What specific inputs would automated steps need?]
    -   **Confidence Threshold for Automated Action:** [If an automated response is considered, what confidence level is required from the detection/AI?]
-   **AI_Agent_Role_in_This_Use_Case:**
    -   [Describe how an AI agent can assist with this detection use-case.]
    -   *Examples:*
        -   "AI can monitor for alerts generated by this rule."
        -   "AI can perform initial triage steps 1.1-1.3 from the SOP."
        -   "AI can enrich IOCs found in the alert using `indicator_handling_protocols.md`."
        -   "If detection confidence >90% AND asset is not critical, AI can trigger automated host isolation as per `automated_response_playbook_criteria.md`."

## 5. Testing & Validation Plan

-   **Test Scenarios (Simulated & Real-World):**
    -   [Describe how this detection will be tested. E.g., Use Atomic Red Team, custom scripts, replay of historical data.]
-   **Expected True Positive Outcome:** [What should happen when the malicious activity is correctly detected?]
-   **Expected False Positive Scenarios to Test:** [What legitimate activities will be tested to ensure they don't trigger the alert?]
-   **Success Criteria for Testing:** [e.g., Detection fires on X% of true positive tests, <Y% false positives on benign tests.]

## 6. Delivery & Deployment Notes

-   **Rule ID (once deployed):** `[PlatformSpecificRuleID]`
-   **Associated Runbook/SOP Document:** `[Link to the full runbook, e.g., handle_suspicious_powershell.md]`
-   **Deployment Date:**
-   **Version History:**

## 7. Optimization & Metrics (Post-Deployment)

-   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to Track:**
    -   True Positive / False Positive Rate for this specific detection.
    -   Analyst feedback volume/sentiment (from `ai_decision_review_guidelines.md`).
    -   Time spent by analysts/AI on alerts from this detection.
-   **Review Cycle:** [e.g., Quarterly, or after X number of alerts]
-   **Lessons Learned / Improvement Areas:** [To be filled in during optimization reviews]
