# Atomic Runbooks

Atomic runbooks are designed as granular, single-purpose procedures that form the building blocks for more complex security investigations and response actions. Each runbook focuses on a specific task related to a particular entity type (e.g., enriching an IP address, checking a file hash against threat intelligence). This modular approach promotes reusability, consistency, and easier automation. Explore the categories below to find runbooks tailored to different indicator types.
