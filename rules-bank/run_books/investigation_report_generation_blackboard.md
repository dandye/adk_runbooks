## Report Structure
1. **Executive Summary** (1-2 pages)
2. **Investigation Overview**
3. **Key Findings**
4. **Technical Analysis**
5. **Attack Timeline**
6. **Risk Assessment**
7. **Recommendations**
8. **Indicators of Compromise**
9. **Appendices**

## Writing Guidelines
- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid excessive technical jargon in executive sections
- Support all claims with evidence
- Include confidence levels
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Structure for easy navigation

## Quality Checks
- Verify all findings are included
- Confirm evidence supports conclusions
- Ensure recommendations are practical
- Check for completeness and clarity
- Review for sensitive information

Always tailor the report to the intended audience while maintaining technical accuracy.
