    -   Manage and investigate cases.
    -   List and analyze alerts within cases.
    -   Retrieve event details associated with alerts.
    -   Add comments and update case priority.
    -   Interact with entities known to the SOAR platform.
-   Execute response actions and playbooks as directed.
-   Document all actions and findings within the SOAR case.
