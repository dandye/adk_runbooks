[soc_analyst_tier2]: ## Incident Report: Case 2451 - SOAR/Chronicle Discrepancy and File IoC Investigation

### Summary

This report details the investigation into a discrepancy between a SOAR case (ID 2451) and corresponding alerts within Chronicle SIEM. The SOAR case, titled "ATI High Priority Rule Match for File IoCs (principal.process.file.sha256)", was flagged as Priority Critical and associated with 9 alerts. However, initial investigation failed to retrieve associated alerts from SOAR and revealed potential inconsistencies with alerts found in Chronicle.

### Observed Issues

*   **SOAR Alert Retrieval Failure:** Attempts to list alerts associated with Case 2451 using the `list_alerts_by_case` tool resulted in an empty list.
*   **SOAR/Chronicle Case ID Mismatch:** Security alerts in Chronicle matching the rule name "ATI High Priority Rule Match for File IoCs (principal.process.file.sha256)" were associated with a different case ID (296d0a48-3f83-4fbd-b152-0ac32f6768c0).
*   **SOAR/Chronicle Severity Mismatch:** Alerts in Chronicle were listed as Severity High, whereas the SOAR case was marked as Priority Critical.
*   **Limited Alert Correlation:** Only two Chronicle alerts were initially identified as potentially related to SOAR case 2451, despite the case indicating 9 associated alerts.
*   **Querying Challenges:** Attempts to query file SHA256 events directly within Chronicle using natural language queries failed.
*   **Threat Intel Lookup Failure:** Attempts to get threat intelligence on a known malicious hash were unsuccessful.

### Investigation Steps & MCP Tools Used

1.  **SOAR Case Assessment:**
    *   Attempted to retrieve full case details using `secops-soar:get_case_full_details`, but this also failed to retrieve associated alerts and comments.
    *   Verified the SOAR case ID and display name.
2.  **Chronicle Alert Correlation:**
    *   Searched for security alerts in Chronicle based on the rule name "ATI High Priority Rule Match for File IoCs (principal.process.file.sha256)" using `secops-mcp:get_security_alerts`. The query parameter did not filter the results as expected.
    *   Identified alerts associated with a different case ID (296d0a48-3f83-4fbd-b152-0ac32f6768c0) and a lower severity (High).
    *   Attempted to list all alerts with the rule name, which also failed to filter correctly using `secops-mcp:get_security_alerts`.
3.  **Chronicle Event Querying:**
    *   Attempted to search security events containing file SHA256 values using natural language queries with `secops-mcp:search_security_events`, but these attempts failed.
4.  **Threat Intelligence Enrichment:**
    *   Tried to obtain threat intelligence on a known malicious file hash using `gti-mcp:get_threat_intel`, but this was unsuccessful.
5. **Additional Tools:**
    * Attempted to list the alerts associated with the case using `secops-soar:list_alerts_by_case`, but this failed.

### Findings

The investigation revealed a significant discrepancy between the information presented in SOAR and the corresponding data available in Chronicle. This inconsistency raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of incident data across the security platforms. Furthermore, there are difficulties in querying events based on file SHA256 values.

### Recommendations

1.  **Investigate SOAR/Chronicle Integration:** A thorough review of the integration between SOAR and Chronicle is necessary to identify the root cause of the case ID and alert synchronization issues.
2.  **Validate Alerting Logic:** Review the logic of the "ATI High Priority Rule Match for File IoCs (principal.process.file.sha256)" rule to ensure that alerts are being generated and classified correctly in Chronicle.
3.  **Improve Querying Capabilities:** Investigate the limitations of querying file SHA256 events in Chronicle and identify alternative methods for retrieving this information.
4.  **Escalate for Further Analysis:** Given the inconsistencies and technical difficulties encountered, this case requires further analysis by Tier 3 analysts with expertise in SOAR/SIEM integration and threat intelligence.

### Next Steps

*   Escalate this report to Tier 3 for further investigation.
*   Engage with the SOAR and Chronicle platform owners to address the integration and querying issues.
*   Document the findings and recommendations in the relevant case management system.
