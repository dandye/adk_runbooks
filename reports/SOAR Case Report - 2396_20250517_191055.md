## SOAR Case Report: 2396

**Case Summary:**

*   Case ID: 2396
*   Name: ursnif_malware_dns
*   Priority: Critical
*   Status: Opened
*   Assignee: @Tier1
*   Description: The case title suggests a Ursnif malware infection with DNS activity. No alerts or alert group identifiers were returned by the API.

**Analysis:**

The case lacks associated alerts, but comments suggest the presence of Ursnif malware and DNS activity. Previous actions include attempts to generate reports and enrich with threat intelligence. It's unusual to have a critical case with no alerts, which may indicate a detection gap.

**Recommendation:**

Given the 'Critical' priority and potential Ursnif malware involvement, a proactive threat hunt for Ursnif-related domains and network activity is highly recommended.

1.  **Intelligence Gathering:** Utilize GTI to gather IOCs associated with Ursnif malware. Focus on recent campaigns and commonly used domains.
2.  **SIEM Event Search:** Search the SIEM for DNS queries, network connections, and process activity involving the gathered IOCs.
3.  **Endpoint Analysis:** If possible, pivot to endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to identify any hosts exhibiting Ursnif-like behavior.
4.  **Review Previous Reports:** Review previous reports (if available) in the case comments to determine any actions already taken and avoid duplication of effort.
5.  **Escalation:** Consider escalating to Tier 3 or Incident Response (IR) if suspicious activity is found.
6.  **Detection Gap Analysis:** Investigate why the initial infection did not trigger an alert. This may require tuning existing detection rules or creating new ones.

Given the "Critical" priority, this requires immediate attention.
