## Investigation Report Generation Runbook

### Phase 1: Data Collection and Analysis
1. Read all blackboard knowledge areas:
   - Investigation metadata and context
   - Network analysis findings
   - Endpoint behavior observations
   - Log correlation results
   - IOC enrichment and threat intelligence
   - Timeline event sequences
   - Correlation engine results
   - Risk scores and assessments

2. Analyze finding quality:
   - Confidence level distribution
   - Evidence strength assessment
   - Finding completeness evaluation
   - Gap identification

### Phase 2: Executive Summary Development
1. Key findings synthesis:
   - Most critical discoveries
   - Attack vector and methods used
   - Systems and data affected
   - Business impact assessment

2. Risk communication:
   - Current threat level
   - Potential for ongoing compromise
   - Business continuity impacts
   - Regulatory or compliance implications

3. Recommendation priorities:
   - Immediate containment actions
   - Short-term remediation steps
   - Long-term security improvements
   - Resource requirements

### Phase 3: Technical Analysis Documentation
1. Network security findings:
   - Suspicious traffic patterns
   - Command and control communications
   - Data exfiltration indicators
   - Network infrastructure compromises

2. Endpoint security findings:
   - Malware execution evidence
   - Persistence mechanisms
   - Lateral movement artifacts
   - Credential access attempts

3. Log analysis results:
   - Authentication anomalies
   - Cross-system correlations
   - Behavioral pattern deviations
   - Security control violations

4. Threat intelligence insights:
   - IOC reputation and attribution
   - Campaign associations
   - Threat actor TTPs
   - MITRE ATT&CK mappings

### Phase 4: Timeline and Attack Chain Documentation
1. Chronological narrative:
   - Initial compromise vector
   - Attack progression sequence
   - Key escalation points
   - Data access and exfiltration
   - Detection and response timeline

2. Attack phase mapping:
   - Reconnaissance activities
   - Initial access methods
   - Persistence establishment
   - Privilege escalation
   - Lateral movement
   - Data staging and exfiltration
   - Anti-forensics attempts

### Phase 5: Risk Assessment and Impact Analysis
1. Threat level assessment:
   - Attack sophistication level
   - Threat actor capabilities
   - Targeting specificity
   - Ongoing risk indicators

2. Impact evaluation:
   - Data compromise scope
   - System availability impacts
   - Business process disruption
   - Regulatory reporting requirements
   - Reputation and trust impacts

### Phase 6: Remediation Recommendations
1. Immediate actions (0-24 hours):
   - Containment measures
   - Critical system isolation
   - Password resets and access revocation
   - Emergency patches

2. Short-term actions (1-30 days):
   - System rebuilding and hardening
   - Security control improvements
   - Monitoring enhancement
   - Staff training updates

3. Long-term improvements (30+ days):
   - Architecture security reviews
   - Process and procedure updates
   - Technology stack improvements
   - Incident response plan updates

### Phase 7: IOC and Evidence Documentation
1. Comprehensive IOC list:
   - IP addresses with confidence scores
   - Domain names and URLs
   - File hashes and signatures
   - Email addresses and usernames
   - Registry keys and file paths

2. Evidence chain documentation:
   - Source of each finding
   - Confidence level justification
   - Correlation strength assessment
   - Alternative explanation evaluation

### Phase 8: Report Formatting and Quality Review
1. Structure and organization:
   - Clear section hierarchy
   - Consistent formatting
   - Appropriate detail levels for audiences
   - Visual elements where helpful

2. Quality assurance:
   - Fact checking against blackboard data
   - Confidence level accuracy
   - Recommendation feasibility
   - Timeline accuracy verification
