### Phase 4: Timeline and Attack Chain Documentation
1. Chronological narrative:
   - Initial compromise vector
   - Attack progression sequence
   - Key escalation points
   - Data access and exfiltration
   - Detection and response timeline

2. Attack phase mapping:
   - Reconnaissance activities
   - Initial access methods
   - Persistence establishment
   - Privilege escalation
   - Lateral movement
   - Data staging and exfiltration
   - Anti-forensics attempts

### Phase 5: Risk Assessment and Impact Analysis
1. Threat level assessment:
   - Attack sophistication level
   - Threat actor capabilities
   - Targeting specificity
   - Ongoing risk indicators

2. Impact evaluation:
   - Data compromise scope
   - System availability impacts

   - Containment measures
   - Critical system isolation
   - Password resets and access revocation
   - Emergency patches

2. Short-term actions (1-30 days):
   - System rebuilding and hardening
   - Security control improvements
   - Monitoring enhancement
   - Staff training updates

3. Long-term improvements (30+ days):
   - Architecture security reviews
   - Process and procedure updates
   - Technology stack improvements
   - Incident response plan updates
