# SOC Blackboard Future Work

This document captures complex reasoning tasks and architectural decisions that would benefit from deeper analysis and design work.

## High-Value Reasoning Tasks

### 1. Blackboard Architecture Design Decisions

**Complex Areas Requiring Analysis:**
- **Concurrent Access Patterns**: Design optimal locking strategies for multi-agent read/write operations
- **Knowledge Area Taxonomy**: Define relationships and hierarchies between different knowledge areas
- **Query Optimization**: Develop efficient algorithms for cross-area correlations and pattern matching
- **Event Architecture**: Choose between event-driven vs polling for agent coordination

**Key Questions:**
- Should we implement optimistic locking for better performance?
- How do we handle version conflicts when multiple agents update related findings?
- What indexing strategies will support fast correlation queries?

### 2. Investigation Workflow Orchestration

**Design Challenges:**
- **Dynamic Agent Selection**: Algorithm to choose which agents to activate based on investigation context
- **Execution Strategies**: Determine optimal parallel vs sequential investigation phases
- **Correlation Thresholds**: Design adaptive confidence scoring algorithms
- **Termination Logic**: Define clear conditions for investigation completion

**Considerations:**
- Resource allocation when multiple investigations run concurrently
- Priority-based agent scheduling
- Handling investigation timeouts and partial results

### 3. Inter-Agent Communication Patterns

**Architectural Decisions:**
- **Publish-Subscribe Design**: Implement efficient blackboard update notifications
- **Coordination Without Direct Communication**: Ensure agents collaborate effectively through blackboard
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle contradictory findings from different agents
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Design voting/weighting systems for risk scoring

**Research Areas:**
- Study existing blackboard implementations in AI systems
- Evaluate message queue patterns for inspiration
- Consider eventual consistency models

### 4. Correlation Engine Algorithm

**Most Complex Component Requiring Deep Reasoning:**

#### Pattern Recognition

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Machine learning integration points
- Real-time vs batch correlation processing
- Explainability of correlation results

### 5. Knowledge Representation Schema

**Schema Design Requirements:**
- **Universal Finding Format**: Support all investigator types while maintaining specificity
- **Semantic Preservation**: Maintain meaning across different security domains
- **Uncertainty Modeling**: Represent confidence levels and probabilistic findings
- **Relationship Modeling**: Express connections between entities, events, and indicators

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Ontology for security findings

## Next Steps

When ready to tackle these advanced topics:
1. Start with the Correlation Engine Algorithm - it's the heart of the system
2. Design the Knowledge Representation Schema to support all use cases
